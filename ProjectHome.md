The project aims at creating a bgl file reader since dictconv no longer works well. And it is just a personal interest now.

Now it is able to extract most information from Babylon-built bgl files.

All contribution is welcome.

The original information about bgl format was discussed in http://www.woodmann.com/forum/showthread.php?t=7028

Encoding and language specifier information was got through an analysis in dictconv-0.2, with some modification (correction?).
