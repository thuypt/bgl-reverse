# Introduction #

This wiki gives a quick analysis of BGL file structure.

# Details #

## Decompression ##

A BGL file has a 4-byte header.

| **header**    | **extention** | **description**                             |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| 0x12340003  | .BDC        | used as cache by Babylon program          |
| 0x12340002  | .BGL        | generated by the builder in some cases    |
| 0x12340001  | .BGL        | distributed on Babylon site               |

It is compressed by _zlib 1.1.3_.

_Reference_: [discussion by acidmelt and biblio](http://www.woodmann.com/forum/showthread.php?t=7028)

followed by 2-byte unsigned integer, indicating gzip header offset (0x47 or 0x69)

## After Decompression (BGLR) ##

Give the decompressed file an extension **BGLR** and it is denoted as **BGLR** file from now on.

Each BGLR file is a collection of records.

Every record has 1 byte specifier:
  * The low nibble is the record type.
  * The high nibble holds indication of the record length, with the following rule:
    1. high nibble>=4: subtract 4; that is the length
    1. high nibble <4: add 1: that is the number of bytes for the following length (in big-endian format)
> > > _similar structure is used in term property_


So a simple function can read records from a BGLR file:
```
# python 3.0 compatible

def readRecord(fbglr):
    hdr=fbglr.read(1)
    if len(hdr)==0:
        return
    hdr=hdr[0]
    high_nibble=hdr>>4
    rec_type=hdr&0xF
    if rec_type==RC_EOF:
        return (rec_type,None)
    if high_nibble>=4:
        rec_len=high_nibble-4
    else:
        rec_len=parseInt(fbglr.read(high_nibble+1))
    return (rec_type,fbglr.read(rec_len))
```


## Record Structure ##

Currently I know 4 types of records:
|**Record Type**     |**Value**|
|:-------------------|:--------|
|[RC\_GLSPARAM](BGLParameter.md)   | 0x0   |
|[RC\_GLSPROPERTY](BGLProperty.md)   | 0x3   |
|[RC\_TERM](BGLTerm.md)          | 0x1 | 0xA | 0xB ...|
|[RC\_RES](BGLResource.md)            | 0x2   |

RC\_GLSPARAM records come always first usually followed by RC\_GLSPROPERTY records. A BGLR file always ends with some empty records (i.e. high nibble is 4)
